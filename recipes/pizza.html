        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
        flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
        and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high 
        temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients used in the recipe</h3>
        <div>
            <div>½ cup water</div>
            <div>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</div>
            <div>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</div>
            <div>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</div>
            <div>½ teaspoon garlic powder</div>
            <div>½ teaspoon onion powder</div>
            <div>½ teaspoon sugar</div>
            <div>½ teaspoon salt</div>
            <div>¼ teaspoon black pepper</div>
        </div>
        <h3>How to make the pizza step-by-step</h3>
        <div>
            <div>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans. </div>
            <div>2. Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside. </div>
            <div>3. Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms. </div>
            <div>4. Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.) </div>
            <div>5. Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans. </div>
            <div>6. Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. </div>
            <div>7. Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking. </div>
